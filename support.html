<p>
  This is an entirely volunteer project, so you don't have
  any obligation to support it.  The project is licensed under
  <a href="https://github.com/jarney/gyoji/blob/master/LICENSE"> the Apache license</a>
  which is quite permisive and allows use for free under most circumstances.
</p>

<p>
  Having said that, because I am an un-paid volunteer,
  it would help me personally to be able to continue
  developing the project if I had some support.  Please
  feel free to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/JonathanArney">send me any amount</a> so I can go
  hang out at a coffee shop for a change instead of
  being here in my basement working tirelessly
  to improve langugage design.
